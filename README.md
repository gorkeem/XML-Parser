# XML-Parser
- An XML Parser app implemented with Python language.
- This is the project I had done in my internship at Aselsan.
- For privacy reasons, many parts of this project have been clipped. So it became a simple xml parsing application. You can use plants.xml as an example.
- Run start.cmd to start the application.
