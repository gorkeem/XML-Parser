# XML-Parser
### An XML Parser app implemented with Python language.
### This is the project I had done in my internship at Aselsan.
For privacy reasons, many parts of this project have been clipped. So it became a simple xml parsing application.

# HOW TO USE IT
## 1. You need to install Python.
## 2. You need to install Python's bottle library (with pip install bottle or with zip file).
## 3. Run start.cmd to start the application and open localhost:5000 on your browser (Google Chrome is recommended).
#### 3.1 If you will do any changes, delete the recently created files under none directory then restart.
## 4. When you open the application, choose any xml file to parse, then you will see parsed data with tables.
